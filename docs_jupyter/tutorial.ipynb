    "Let's start with a few terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **crate**. A collection of containerized executables. A crate is analogous to a docker image (but it provides *multiple* commands by pointing to *multiple* images).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **manifest**. A manifest defines a crate. It is a list of commands and images to be included in the crate. A manifest is analogous to a Dockerfile. It could be thought of as a *Cratefile*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **load**. Loading a manifest will create a local folder with executables for each command in the manifest. Loading a manifest is analogous to building or pulling an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **activate**. Activating a crate is what allows you to run the commands in a crate. Activating is analogous to starting a container. Any loaded crates are available to activate. Activating a crate does nothing more than prepend the crate folder to your `PATH` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The executables are created upon `load`, and merely added to your PATH upon `activate.` Therefore, if you adjust settings in your bulker config (such as VOLUMES or ENVVARS), you'll need to re-load the manifests to update the actual bulker containerized executables. As of version `0.7.0`, you can do this easily with `bulker reload` upon a config file change.\n"

There is no container that contains both `fortune` and `cowsay`; instead, we have individual containers for each command, and then wrapped each command in an executable. Both of these commands are in our PATH because they're both included in the crate.\n",
