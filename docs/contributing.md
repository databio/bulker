## Contributing

Pull requests or issues are welcome. After adding a new feature, please add tests in the `tests` folder and run the test suite. The only additional dependencies needed beyond those for the package can be installed with: `pip install -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt`.
  
Once those are installed, run the tests with `pytest` or `python setup.py test`.
